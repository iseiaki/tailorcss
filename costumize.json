      // what you think if we assigned true or false values to these keys and then javascript was to read it and change css file depending on that?
      // so for example if user wanted to costumize an element even more they would just change let's take "flex" for example and set its value to true
      // sounds little bit complex I know but I'll try to write down a detailed plan how we can achieve it
