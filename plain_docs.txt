I created main.go file in order to interact with costumize.json. main goal for it is to get data from json and then modify css or add already ready-to-go component to html
for now all it does it to get data from .json file. Will add more detailed documentation soon
for testing you could clone the repo, install golang on your machine and write "go run main.go" in terminal
